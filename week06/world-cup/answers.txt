Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

    Men World Cup 2018      Woman World Cup 2019
        1. France               1. United States
        2. Croatia              2. Netherlands
        3. Belgium              3. England
        4. England              4. Sweden

In the "Men World Cup 2018" with all number of simulations (from 10 to 1000000)
proved incorrect in all simulations. Instead in the "Woman World Cup 2019" the
predictions,  with all number of simulations (from 10 to 1000000),are been
slightly near to the real result.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations
